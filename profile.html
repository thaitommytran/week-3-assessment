      <p>
        After studying biomedical engineering, Thai began work in the industry.
        He primarily focused on servicing ventilators. He loved to troubleshoot
        and fix broken machines. Along the way, he picked up an interest in
        coding and wanted to see if he could combine the problem-solving aspects
        from his current job with his newfound love for coding. Today, Thai is
        currently enrolled in DevMountain's coding bootcamp. He aspires to
        finish the course with flying colors, hoping it will equip him with all
        the tools necessary to land his dream job as a software developer.
